------------------------------------
From the start, our first objective
was to implement the structs needed
for this assignment. Clearly an easy
first step into the assignment. This
includes Header, Question, and Answer
structs, with their respective fields,
as well as a struct to group all of
these "meta"-structs.
------------------------------------
The area in which we had the most
trouble was getting our implementation
to receive a response successfully.
Also, we had difficutly with our
implementation of reading/writing a
byte array. That said, for both of
these difficulties, we were able to
overcome using printf testing, and in
result we believe these two issues we
faced turned out to be strong suits of
our final product.
-------------------------------------
As stated before, we went about testing
our implementations primarily with
printf debugging lines. We chose this
approach primarily because nobody in
our group is particularly comfortable
using gdb as a means of debugging. Apart
from the two issues stated above, we had
a fairly easy time with this assignment,
and thus using printf lines for debugging
was sufficient means to complete project 3
successfully.
